Welcome to the GitHub repository for my personal developer portfolio! This site is designed and built by me, Adri√† Entreserra, to showcase my journey as a Full-Stack Developer, my projects, skills, and a bit about who I am. This repository contains the source code for my live portfolio, available for review of my coding practices and implementation details.

## üëã About Me

I'm Adri, a 24-year-old passionate Full-Stack Developer based in Spain, currently finishing my Higher National Diploma (Grado Superior) in Multiplatform Application Development (DAM). My programming adventure started with video games, evolved into web development, and has recently expanded to mobile app creation, with a strong focus on **React** and **React Native**.

I consider myself a full-stack developer because I genuinely enjoy working on both the frontend (crafting intuitive user interfaces) and the backend (building robust and efficient logic). My background includes:
*   **Interactive Graphic Product Assistant (Cifog):** Video editing, graphic design, 3D modeling, web & game programming basics.
*   **Private Degree in 3D Design for Video Games (FXAnimation Barcelona):** Deep dive into 3D modeling, assets, environments, characters, texturing, retopology, sculpting, and game engines.
*   **Multiplatform Application Development (Florida):** Solidifying my app development skills with C#, JavaScript, Java, React Native, SQL, MongoDB, and more.

My journey has been a blend of formal education and enthusiastic self-learning, always driven by a curiosity to build and create.
